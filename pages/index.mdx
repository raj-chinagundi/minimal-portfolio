# Basavraj Chinagundi

I’m a software engineer who works on backend systems where performance and reliability matter. I’m currently pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science at **Arizona State University**, focusing on backend engineering, data pipelines, and applied AI systems that actually run in production.

Most of my work has been about taking slow or fragile systems and making them faster, safer, and easier to operate.

## Experience

### Software Engineer Analyst | Deloitte
*Oct 2023 - July 2025*

- Worked on a FastAPI backend shared by multiple internal teams. Most of the work was around tightening API contracts, validation, and error handling so teams could integrate without breaking each other.

- Took slow and failure-prone workflows and moved the expensive parts into asynchronous background jobs. This removed request timeouts and reduced end-to-end processing from hours to under an hour.

- Built and ran data pipelines and the surrounding infrastructure, including ETL into Snowflake, logging, metrics, testing, and deployment. The focus was on making failures predictable and easy to recover from.

### Software Development Engineer Intern | Samsung SDS
*Mar 2023 - June 2023*

- Helped replace a manual inventory workflow with a small Java and React service that teams actually used day to day. It centralized product state and reduced mistakes caused by spreadsheets.

- Used the inventory data to experiment with time-series forecasting using ARIMA and Prophet, mainly to understand demand patterns and help the team plan stock more reliably.

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/raj-chinagundi/Slapp) | *Python, PyTorch, Multimodal Models*

A clothing recommendation system driven by user feedback. I used a vision model to extract attributes from product images and built a graph-based preference model that updates with each interaction. The system indexes over 5,800 items and produces recommendations that stay consistent over time.
