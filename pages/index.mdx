# Basavraj Chinagundi

I work on backend systems where things break *after* they ship.

Most of my time goes into data pipelines, internal platforms, and AI-backed tooling that other teams quietly depend on. I like taking slow, fragile workflows and turning them into systems that are boring, predictable, and hard to misuse.

I’m currently pursuing a **Master’s in Computer Science at Arizona State University**.

## Experience

### Deloitte - Software Engineer  
*Oct 2023 - July 2025*

- Backend + data pipelines for internal banking and AI tools.  
- Turned manual / legacy ETL and document workflows into systems that didn’t need babysitting.  
- Spent a lot of time moving heavy work off the request path and making failures obvious instead of silent.

*Mar 2023 - Jun 2023*

- Built an inventory microservice to replace spreadsheet workflows.
