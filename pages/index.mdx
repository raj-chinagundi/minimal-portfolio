# Basavraj Chinagundi

Hey, I'm an AI Software Engineer with a passion for building intelligent systems and scalable solutions. Currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at Arizona State University, I specialize in AI/ML, full-stack development, and data engineering.

I've built RAG-based chatbots, automated code generation pipelines, and agentic AI workflows. I love working with cutting-edge technologies like LangChain, PyTorch, and modern web frameworks to solve real-world problems.

## Experience

### AI Software Engineer | Deloitte
*Oct 2023 – July 2025*

- Built a **chatbot** that actually understands banking documents by figuring out how to chunk them based on token limits and process them **asynchronously**. Also automated the conversion of old **Informatica XML mappings into SQL** - basically turned **weeks of manual migration into a button click**.
- Connected **four different AI tools** to work together using **LangGraph**, so they automatically hand off tasks to each other. Also built **ETL pipelines** that pull data from **GCP and Azure**, then load it into **Snowflake and Databricks** without breaking.

### Software Development Engineer Intern | Samsung SDS
*Mar 2023 – June 2023*

- Replaced manual inventory tracking with a **Java/React microservice** that handles **1,000+ products**. Cut errors by **90%** and saved the team **10 hours a week**. Then used that data to build **ARIMA and Prophet models** that predict demand **30% better** than before.

Took the STaR paper and implemented it from scratch on **Llama 3.2-3B**. Started strong at **73.8%** on math problems, but then watched it collapse to **64.9%**. Spent time figuring out why - turns out the model was generating increasingly bad training examples for itself. The real project was **debugging why self-improvement broke down**.

Tinder for clothes. You swipe, it learns. Used a **vision model** to understand what's in the images, then built a **graph of your preferences** that updates with every swipe. Indexed **5,800+ items** so recommendations actually make sense.

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/raj-chinagundi/shadowsearch) | *JavaScript, Cloudflare Workers, Llama 3.1*

**Chrome extension** that answers questions about whatever page you're reading. Runs on **Cloudflare's edge** so it's fast. The tricky part was keeping conversations separate for each tab while sharing the same context. **Won a hackathon** competing against **600+ people**.
